    <h2>what is css?</h2>
    <ol type="1" id="hi">
        <li>Css stands for cascading style sheets</li>
        <br><li>css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br><li> <b> <strike>Css is not neccessary </strike> <span id ="first">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br><li><u>external stylesheets are stored in css files.</u></li>
    </ol>
    <h2> <i>Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element in link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><span id ="first">in this tutorial  we will use inline and internal styles</span></b>,because this is easier to demonstate, and easier for you to ry it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on yhe other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p>in CSS, seelectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element</p>
    <p>there is a widerange of selectors vailable. two of the most commonly used ae class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
